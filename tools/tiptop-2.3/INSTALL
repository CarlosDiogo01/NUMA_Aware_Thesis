Tiptop can be built in two ways:
- in-directory, mixing object files with source code;
- in another directory.


* In-directory

1. cd /where/you/unpacked/tiptop-x.y
2.  ./configure [--prefix=/some/where]
3.  make
(4. optional)  make install



* In another directory

1.  mkdir build-dir
2.  cd build-dir
3.  /where/you/unpacked/tiptop-x.y/configure  [--prefix=/some/where]
4.  make
(5. optional)  make install
